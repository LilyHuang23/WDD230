            In the navigation bar on the top, the web designer leaves space between the school and the search logo. 
            This makes the header looks simple and organized, the user can select the icon according to their needs. 
            Below the navigation bar, there is a heading that indicates the name of the school. It does not contain other
            stuff which makes the title big and clear. The pictures are centered and have white space around them. 
            The space is the same amount away from the broader and another object.
