            <p>The city of Rexburg was founded in March 1883 when an intrepid group of pioneers decided to settle along the banks of the Teton River. 
            They had been sent by church leaders in Salt Lake City, under the direction of Thomas E. Ricks, to settle the Upper Snake River Valley. 
            The new community, named Rexburg after their leader (Ricks being German for Rex or King) quickly attracted men and women eager to bring
            industry and civilization to the West. By the time Idaho entered the Union as the 43rd state in 1890, Rexburg was the second largest 
            city in the state.</p>
